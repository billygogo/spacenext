# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**space.NEXT** - A single meeting room booking web service built with Next.js 15, targeting 90%+ automation rate for meeting room reservations with contactless entry and payment processing.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15.1.0** with App Router and Turbopack for development
- **React 19.0.0** with concurrent features
- **TypeScript** with relaxed settings (strictNullChecks: false, noImplicitAny: false)
- **shadcn/ui** component library (17 components ready)
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom design system and dark/light mode
- **Zustand** for client state management
- **TanStack Query 5** for server state management
- **React Hook Form + Zod** for form validation
- **Supabase** (implemented) for PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage with full CRUD operations
- **Axios** for webhook integration and external API calls
- **Stripe** (planned) for payment processing

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development (with Turbopack)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Production server
npm run start

# Linting
npm run lint
```

## Code Architecture

### Current Structure
- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router with layout.tsx, providers.tsx
  - `/service` - Service gallery page with image showcase
  - `/reservations` - Booking management with search/filtering
  - `/booking` - Main booking page
  - `/api/booking/availability/` - API routes (skeleton)
- `src/components/` - Business logic components
  - `booking-modal.tsx` - Full 3-step booking process (400+ lines)
  - `time-slot-selector.tsx` - Interactive time selection
  - Landing page sections (hero, features, pricing, testimonials, footer)
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui component library (17+ components)
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks (toast system ready)
- `src/lib/` - Utility and integration layer
  - `supabase/` - Complete Supabase client/server integration
  - `utils.ts` - Utility functions with cn() helper

### Provider Setup
Root layout includes providers for:
